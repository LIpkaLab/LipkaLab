                    <p><strong>Principal Investigator</strong></p>
                    <p>Dr. Lipka leads the Lipka Lab, specializing in quantitative genetics for crops. His background is in applied statistics, and really enjoys using this background to develop more robust genotype-to-phenotype approaches. Outside of work, Dr. Lipka enjoys hanging out with his family, going long-distance running, and playing piano and guitar. Dr. Lipka tries to visit a different national park each summer.</p>
